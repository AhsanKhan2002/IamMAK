								<p class="front-text">My name is Muhammad Ahsan Khan, although I prefer being addressed by my middle name, Ahsan. I'm currently in my penultimate year studying computer science. My primary goal is to gain hands-on experience in the field that I envision building my career in. The dynamic nature of programming has always intrigued me; its constant evolution ensures that every day brings new challenges. I find these challenges invigorating because they compel me to continuously stretch my problem-solving skills. The feeling of overcoming these hurdles is incredibly rewarding and drives my passion for programming. Pursuing this degree is my way of embracing these challenges and consistently growing as a programmer. Thus, I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships or co-op positions in software development to further enhance my knowledge and skill set.</p>

								<p class="intTxt">Anime and manga have always been my go-to forms of entertainment. Manga, essentially Japanese comic books, are the source material for anime, the animated adaptations. My journey into this world started at a very young age, particularly with the iconic 'Dragon Ball Z,' which I avidly watched with my brother. It marked the beginning of a lifelong passion for these art forms.
									Initially, I was solely an anime fan, relishing in the animated versions. However, I soon realized that numerous captivating stories might never receive an animated adaptation or were progressing too slowly. During high school, I delved into manga as a way to ensure I stayed engaged in reading. Little did I anticipate eagerly awaiting weekly chapters as I do now.
									Anime and manga, despite being misunderstood as mere cartoons, offer me a sense of relaxation and pure enjoyment. Let me assure you, these anime series are no laughing matter; some of the stories are exquisitely crafted in the most beautiful manner.</p>

								<p class="dbzTxt">The Dragon Ball franchise holds a special place in my heart, not only as my gateway into the world of anime but as a cornerstone that has shaped the entire industry. It's more than just a series; it's an iconic cultural phenomenon that transcends borders and generations. As I journeyed alongside Goku, the young martial arts prodigy, I felt the pull of nostalgia intertwined with the awe of witnessing a story that ignited my imagination.

									This epic tale unfolds as Goku evolves into Earth's guardian, supported by his loyal friends and family, confronting recurring malevolent forces threatening our planet's safety. Dragon Ball's narrative weaves a tapestry of adventure, growth, and resilience. It's not merely a saga of battles against evil; it's a narrative that champions perseverance, camaraderie, and the unyielding spirit to protect what's precious.
									
									Through its compelling characters, vibrant storytelling, and unforgettable moments, Dragon Ball has not only captured the hearts of millions but also pioneered and redefined the anime and manga landscape. Its influence extends far beyond entertainment, leaving an indelible mark on pop culture worldwide and serving as an inspiration for countless other works.
									
									Dragon Ball's legacy isn't solely in its breathtaking battles or fantastical elements; it's in the way it has connected with audiences on an emotional level, fostering a community that cherishes its impact and continues to pass on its legacy from one generation to the next.

								<p class="idol">It's remarkable that I was born during an era that witnessed the pinnacle of football greatness, particularly in the form of Cristiano Ronaldo, whom I consider the greatest player of all time. My admiration for Ronaldo began when I was just 6 years old, and since then, I've ardently supported and followed his career. He isn't just another player to me; he symbolizes my passion for the sport and serves as my inspiration to stay connected to it.

									Ronaldo holds a special place in my heart because he embodies the essence of dedication and mental strength. His relentless work ethic has propelled him to the summit of the sport, a testament to his unwavering commitment. In the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, he consistently emerges victorious. His relentless pursuit of excellence is truly awe-inspiring and serves as a testament to his character. It is this quality that I believe everyone should try to apply into their lives and the quality that makes him so beloved for me. Yes, I am a super fan.</p></div>
